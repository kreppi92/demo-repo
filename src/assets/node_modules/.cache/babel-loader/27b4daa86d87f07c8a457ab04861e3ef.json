By using Satstreet, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company to meet all the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the App.<br /><br />In order to comply with applicable Anti Money Laundering (“AML”) and Know Your Client (“KYC”) requirements, Satstreet may limit each transaction to be below certain thresholds depending on your region. For example, users from Canada will be limited to transactions of $1,000 CAD, while European users will be limited to 250 Euros per transaction. In order to exceed these transaction restrictions we will ask for documentation including but not limited to copies of issued identification document (e.g. Driver’s License, Passport, Proof of Address). Corporate accounts require information related to the identification of the directors, officers, and equity owners of the business. We may also use information from third parties to help us confirm your identity and/or determine if we should open or maintain your Account. You agree and warrant at all times that all information provided by you to us is true, accurate, and not fraudulent in any respect. If any such information changes, it is your obligation to provide new information as soon as possible following such change.<br /><br />\n\n        <span className={classes.boldText}>4. Changes to the Terms</span><br /><br />We reserve the right to discontinue or make changes to any Accounts or Services. We may revise and change these Terms, and we may add or delete from these Terms, and the updated version will supersede all prior versions. We will provide notice of changes, additions, and deletions as required by law. If we have provided advance notice and you do not agree with any change, you may close your Account(s) before the effective date of the change, which shall be your sole remedy. Your continued use of Satstreet following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes.<br /><br />\n        \n        <span className={classes.boldText}>5. Satstreet Services</span><br /><br />\nSatstreet provides a way to store, use and manage Bitcoin and any other supported Digital Assets designated by Satstreet. At present, Bitcoin is the only supported Digital Asset, although we reserve the right to add other assets over time. We may make temporary or permanent changes, revisions, or closures of our Services at any time for any reason with or without notice. In this case, you may be prevented from accessing or using our Services. If, in our sole discretion, we decide to permanently discontinue our Services, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with notice such as by email, app notification, and/or posting on social media accounts. You may send and receive supported Digital Assets only to another Satstreet user, or to an external account or waller outside of Satstreet. Satstreet may charge a withdrawal fee in addition to a transaction processing fees charge by the network (payable to the receiver of the block reward in which your transaction is processed). These fees will be displayed by the App before you confirm any transaction to an external wallet address.<br /><br />\nYou are solely responsible for the actions of your Account and for properly securing your passwords or any codes you use to access your Account and the Services. Satstreet is not responsible for any loss or compromise of your access information and/or personal information, or for any loss that you may sustain due to compromise of your access information and/or personal information. We will not be liable for following any instructions we receive through your account, even if it was not authorized by you, or if it was entered by mistake or is otherwise inaccurate. We may require your signature or identification in any form we deem necessary in order to verify the authenticity of any instructions we receive from your Account. You agree to reimburse us (and we may charge your Account) for all claims, costs, losses and damages, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that result from our following of your instructions to take any action related to your account.<br /><br />\n       \n        <span className={classes.boldText}>6. Bitcoin Transactions and Supported Digital Assets</span><br /><br />You acknowledge and agree that the value of a Digital Asset is highly volatile and that buying, selling, and holding any Digital Asset involves a high degree of risk. Digital Asset networks are operated by decentralized networks of independent third parties. Once a transaction has been requested from your Account, the network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request.<br /><br />The applicable Digital Asset network is solely responsible for verifying and confirming transactions that you request and Satstreet cannot confirm, cancel, or reverse transactions to external wallet addresses other than provide confirmation of the network’s completion of a transaction. Satstreet has no control over any Digital Asset network and therefore cannot and does not guarantee that any transaction you request will be completed. You agree that the transaction request may not be completed or may be delayed. When you request a transaction you authorize us to submit your transaction to the applicable network according to your instructions. Once a transaction has been initiated, it cannot be reversed.<br /><br />\n        \n        <span className={classes.boldText}>7. Liability for User Errors</span><br /><br />You agree and acknowledge that Satstreet will not be held responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Digital Asset transaction initiated via the App, including but not limited to the use of any incorrect address.<br /><br />\n        \n        <span className={classes.boldText}>8. Digital Asset Ownership</span><br /><br />You agree to represent and warrant to us at all times during which you hold Digital Assets in your Account that any Digital Asset used by you in connection with your Account is owned by you or that you are validly authorized to carry out transactions using such Digital Assets, and that all transactions are for your own Account on not on behalf of a third party. You represent and warrant that all such Digital Assets are free from any claims, indebtedness, liens, or third party interests.<br /><br />\n\n        <span className={classes.boldText}>9. Consent to SMS and Push Notifications</span><br /><br />To use Satstreet SMS services you must have a valid mobile phone number. If you provide us with a plain text phone number to facilitate an invitation or transfer we may use the phone number for the purpose it was provided and we will then delete such data in accordance with our data retention policies. The App requires permission to send push notifications to your mobile device and you hereby consent to such communications.<br /><br />\n        \n        <span className={classes.boldText}>10. Risk Disclosure</span><br /><br />These Terms and use of Satstreet does not create a fiduciary relationship between us and you; your Account is not a checking or savings account, and is not covered by insurance against losses. We may lend, sell, pledge, hypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of funds and Eligible Digital Assets to counterparties or hold the Eligible Digital Assets with counterparties, and we will use our best commercial and operational efforts to prevent losses.<br /><br />Most Digital Assets are not legal tender, are not backed by any government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital Assets. Transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Any secured account maintained by Satstreet for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers.<br /><br />The volatility and unpredictability of the price of Digital Assets may result in significant loss over a short period of time. The nature of Digital Assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack, including rollback attacks or Blockchain reorganizations. The nature of Digital Assets means that any technological difficulties experienced by Satstreet may prevent the access or use of your Digital Assets and/or cause losses of Digital Assets.\n<br /><br />Although Satstreet uses best practices to protect against cyber threats, circumstances may arise where we experience losses or damages. In that event, Satstreet shall use it balance sheet to cover damages. If the losses exceed Satstreet’s balance sheet, you authorize Satstreet to use Eligible Digital Assets to absorb the remaining losses.<br /><br />\n\n        <span className={classes.boldText}>11.

These Terms allow you to use the App for non-commercial use only.

Any request that exceeds the transaction limit for your region will require identification per KYC and AML requirements. Satstreet will initiate the withdrawal process following a withdrawal request when possible, but we may require up to three (3) days after you submit your withdrawal request in order to process the transaction.<br /><br />Satstreet and our payment partners may experience cyber-attacks, extreme market conditions, or operational and technical difficulties which could result in the immediate suspension of deposits and/or withdrawals either temporarily or permanently. Satstreet will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred to you as a result of such suspension of deposits or withdrawals. Withdrawal limits based on amounts and frequency may apply from time to time. Every withdrawal request shall be deemed as pending until accepted by us. We may deny such request, or delay the processing of an approved request for any reason, including but not limited to insufficient funds in your Account, inaccurate or misleading information you provided, or any suspicion of money laundering or other financial crime related to your Account. Any individual request to exceed withdrawal limits set by Satstreet may be sent via email to ​support@satstreet.com<br /><br />\n        \n        <span className={classes.boldText}>13. Hard Forks</span><br /><br />Digital Assets may experience a Hard Fork which results in two separate chains and Digital Asset versions on each chain. As a result of the technical complexity of supporting Hard Forks, the support of any new Digital Asset in your account is solely at the discretion of Satstreet. The support of said Digital Asset may or may not be announced on our social media accounts or in a notification to you. You hereby agree that Satstreet assumes no responsibility whatsoever with respect to new Digital Assets that result from a Hard Fork.<br /><br />\n        \n        <span className={classes.boldText}>14. Payments to Email Addresses, Phone Numbers, & Social Media Usernames</span><br /><br />Satstreet offers a proprietary Digital Asset payment tool to our users. Satstreet allows you to send payments of Digital Assets to any email address and eventually other mediums such as phone numbers and social media usernames. By using Satstreet you understand and acknowledge that the transfer of funds by Satstreet is not recorded on any Digital Asset blockchain. The transfer is managed on Satstreet’s internal system. Any payment sent to the wrong user may be irrecoverable, and is your sole responsibility to provide the correct address, number, or username. The completion of a transfer may not be immediate and it may take time before the transfer is processed and the receiver’s account is credited. The use of Satstreet is limited in amount transferred as determined by our AML and KYC policies, which may change from time to time.
