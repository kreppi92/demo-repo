Eligibility and AML Considerations</span><br /><br />Satstreet is offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older, and most countries around the world. Please be advised that in some jurisdictions, due to regulatory considerations, Satstreet may not provide part or all of the Services. By using Satstreet, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company to meet all the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the App.<br /><br />In order to comply with applicable Anti Money Laundering (“AML”) and Know Your Client (“KYC”) requirements, Satstreet may limit each transaction to be below certain thresholds depending on your region. For example, users from Canada will be limited to transactions of $1,000 CAD, while European users will be limited to 250 Euros per transaction. In order to exceed these transaction restrictions we will ask for documentation including but not limited to copies of issued identification document (e.g. Driver’s License, Passport, Proof of Address). Corporate accounts require information related to the identification of the directors, officers, and equity owners of the business. We may also use information from third parties to help us confirm your identity and/or determine if we should open or maintain your Account. You agree and warrant at all times that all information provided by you to us is true, accurate, and not fraudulent in any respect. If any such information changes, it is your obligation to provide new information as soon as possible following such change.<br /><br />\n\n        <span className={classes.boldText}>4. Changes to the Terms</span><br /><br />We reserve the right to discontinue or make changes to any Accounts or Services. We may revise and change these Terms, and we may add or delete from these Terms, and the updated version will supersede all prior versions. We will provide notice of changes, additions, and deletions as required by law. If we have provided advance notice and you do not agree with any change, you may close your Account(s) before the effective date of the change, which shall be your sole remedy. Your continued use of Satstreet following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes.<br /><br />\n        \n        <span className={classes.boldText}>5. Satstreet Services</span><br /><br />\nSatstreet provides a way to store, use and manage Bitcoin and any other supported Digital Assets designated by Satstreet. At present, Bitcoin is the only supported Digital Asset, although we reserve the right to add other assets over time. We may make temporary or permanent changes, revisions, or closures of our Services at any time for any reason with or without notice. In this case, you may be prevented from accessing or using our Services. If, in our sole discretion, we decide to permanently discontinue our Services, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with notice such as by email, app notification, and/or posting on social media accounts. You may send and receive supported Digital Assets only to another Satstreet user, or to an external account or waller outside of Satstreet. Satstreet may charge a withdrawal fee in addition to a transaction processing fees charge by the network (payable to the receiver of the block reward in which your transaction is processed). These fees will be displayed by the App before you confirm any transaction to an external wallet address.<br /><br />\nYou are solely responsible for the actions of your Account and for properly securing your passwords or any codes you use to access your Account and the Services. Satstreet is not responsible for any loss or compromise of your access information and/or personal information, or for any loss that you may sustain due to compromise of your access information and/or personal information. We will not be liable for following any instructions we receive through your account, even if it was not authorized by you, or if it was entered by mistake or is otherwise inaccurate. We may require your signature or identification in any form we deem necessary in order to verify the authenticity of any instructions we receive from your Account. You agree to reimburse us (and we may charge your Account) for all claims, costs, losses and damages, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that result from our following of your instructions to take any action related to your account.<br /><br />\n       \n        <span className={classes.boldText}>6. Bitcoin Transactions and Supported Digital Assets</span><br /><br />You acknowledge and agree that the value of a Digital Asset is highly volatile and that buying, selling, and holding any Digital Asset involves a high degree of risk. Digital Asset networks are operated by decentralized networks of independent third parties. Once a transaction has been requested from your Account, the network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request.<br /><br />The applicable Digital Asset network is solely responsible for verifying and confirming transactions that you request and Satstreet cannot confirm, cancel, or reverse transactions to external wallet addresses other than provide confirmation of the network’s completion of a transaction. Satstreet has no control over any Digital Asset network and therefore cannot and does not guarantee that any transaction you request will be completed. You agree that the transaction request may not be completed or may be delayed. When you request a transaction you authorize us to submit your transaction to the applicable network according to your instructions. Once a transaction has been initiated, it cannot be reversed.<br /><br />\n        </p>\n      </div>  \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nTerms.propTypes = {\n  classes: PropTypes.object.isRequired\n}\n\nexport default withStyles(styles)(Terms)"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
