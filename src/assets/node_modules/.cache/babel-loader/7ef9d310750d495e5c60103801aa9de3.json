Internet software (“Software”) made available to you by Blockstack PBC (“Blockstack”). By clicking “I Accept,” or by downloading, installing, or otherwise accessing or using the Software, you agree that you have read and understood, and, as a condition to your download of the Software, you agree to be bound by, the following terms and conditions.\n        <br /><br />\n\n        1. <span className={classes.boldText}>Overview.</span> The Software is provided to you for the purpose of creating a Blockstack ID and verifying you as a unique human user via your telephone number through a third-party verification service called Twilio. Verification requires a legitimate mobile phone number from a wireless phone carrier. Landlines and voice-over-IPs (VOIPs) are excluded.<br /><br />\n        2. <span className={classes.boldText}>Eligibility.</span> You must be at least 18 years old to use the Software. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years old and (b) your registration and your use of the Software is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations.<br /><br />\n        3. <span className={classes.boldText}>Payments.</span> Subject to applicable law, the Software also allows you to input a Bitcoin wallet address to receive a limited, one-time payment of Bitcoin in return for verification and for creating a Blockstack ID, as well as for certain referral activities as indicated in the Software and as further described below. The amount of Bitcoin payment will be clearly disclosed in the Software and is subject to modification or termination in the sole discretion of Blockstack. Bitcoin payments may be subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Certain persons, such as persons on the U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Asset Control’s exclusion list or persons in geographies where cryptocurrency is illegal, may be ineligible to receive Bitcoin payments. Nothing in these Terms in any way establishes a legal right or entitlement to Bitcoin payment. Blockstack plans to initiate payments within approximately 14 days of registration or approval of a Reward, however, Bitcoin transaction times may vary and Blockstack cannot guarantee when the transaction will be completed.<br /><br />\n        4. <span className={classes.boldText}>Referrals.</span> You may refer other people to sign up for a Blockstack ID by sharing your unique referral link. Blockstack will pay you a one-time payment of Bitcoin in return for each valid referral (a “Reward”). To be a valid referral, the person you refer must be: (1) a unique human user with a legitimate mobile number from a wireless phone carrier (as verified through our third-party verification service) (2) who downloads the Software using your referral link and (3) completes the Blockstack ID registration and verification process in accordance with these Terms. Referrals should only be used for personal and non-commercial purposes. Referral links should not be published or distributed on commercial websites (such as coupon websites or Reddit) or on blogs. You are prohibited from “spamming” anyone with referral links. This includes mass emailing, texting or messaging people you do not know or using automated systems or bots through any channel to distribute your referral link. Only one Blockstack ID registration per mobile number is permitted; if your referred friend has already registered for a Blockstack ID prior to using your referral link, you will not be entitled to any Rewards for such referral. Rewards are subject to verification. Blockstack may withhold a Reward for investigation, or refuse to process any transaction Blockstack deems fraudulent, suspicious, in violation of these Terms, or believes will impose liability on Blockstack, its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents. All Blockstack decisions are final and binding, including decisions as to whether a referral is valid.<br /><br />\n        5. <span className={classes.boldText}>Ownership; Proprietary Rights.</span> The Software is owned by Blockstack. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Software (“<span className={classes.boldText}>Materials</span>”) provided by Blockstack are protected by intellectual property and other laws. All Materials included in the Software are the property of Blockstack or its third-party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by Blockstack, you may not make use of the Materials. Blockstack reserves all rights in and to the Materials not granted expressly in these Terms.<br /><br />\n        6. <span className={classes.boldText}>Text Messaging; Emails.</span> Blockstack and those acting on our behalf may send you text (SMS) messages at the phone number you provide us. These messages may include operational messages about your use of the Software, as well as marketing messages. You may opt out of receiving marketing and/or operational text messages at any time by sending an email to support@yournewinternet.com indicating that you no longer wish to receive such texts along with the phone number of the mobile device receiving the texts OR by replying to any text you receive with “STOP” from the mobile device receiving the messages. You may continue to receive text messages for a short period while Blockstack processes your request, and you may also receive text messages confirming the receipt of your opt-out request. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system. Your agreement to receive text messages is not a condition of any purchase or use of the Software. Standard data and message rates may apply whenever you send or receive such messages, as specified by your carrier. We may also send you emails concerning out products and services, as well as those of third parties. You may opt out of promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in the promotional email itself.<br /><br />\n        7. <span className={classes.boldText}>Licenses.</span> <br/><br/>\n        <p className={classes.indentedText}>7.1. <span className={classes.boldText}>Limited License.</span> Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Blockstack grants you, solely for your personal use, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the Software.</p><br /><br />\n        <p className={classes.indentedText}>7.2. <span className={classes.boldText}>License Restrictions.</span> Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may not: (a) reproduce, distribute, publicly display, or publicly perform the Software; (b) make modifications to the Software; or (c) interfere with or circumvent any feature of the Software, including any security or access control mechanism. If you are prohibited under applicable law from using the Software, you may not use it.</p><br /><br />\n        <p className={classes.indentedText}>7.3. <span className={classes.boldText}>No Trademark License.</span> You acknowledge and agree that these Terms do not provide you with any right or license to use any trade name, trademark, service mark, or other indicator of Blockstack or any of its affiliates, and you agree not to use any Blockstack trade name, trademark, or service mark without Blockstack’s express written consent.</p><br /><br />\n        8. <span className={classes.boldText}>Term; Termination.</span> These Terms are effective beginning when you accept the Terms or first download, install, access, or use the Software, and ending when you cease all use of the Software. Blockstack may, at its sole discretion, terminate these Terms, cease offering the referral program described herein, or suspend or terminate your access to the Software, at any time for any reason or no reason, with or without notice. Sections 6, 8,12, 13, 14, and 16 will survive termination.<br /><br />\n        9. <span className={classes.boldText}>Third Party Linked Websites.</span> Blockstack may provide tools through the Software that enable you to export information to third party services. By using one of these tools, you agree that Blockstack may transfer that information to the applicable third party service. Third party services are not under Blockstack’s control, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Blockstack is not responsible for any third party service’s use of your exported information.
